# COVID-19 Bot
A Twitter [bot](https://twitter.com/COVID19twtbot) that automatically replies to tweets requesting COVID related resources with links containing information about the availability. 

People are currently tweeting asking about the availability of oxygen cylinders and other medical care in their area. Seeing this, we decided to create a twitter bot that replies to such tweets with links to other tweets which contain information about the asked availability in their particular city.
